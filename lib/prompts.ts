You will create a compact memory of the just-completed scene. This memory is used as long-term context for future generations.
Write a 1-2 paragraph scene summary (no more than 300 words in total).
Use proper names and refer to the protagonist as "you".
Capture only plot-relevant facts that will matter later such as:
what ${protagonistName} does/learns/decides,
changes to location, inventory, injuries, or relationships,
discoveries/clues,
unresolved goals, promises, threats, or deadlines.
Do not quote dialogue, add new facts, or include stylistic prose.
Return only the summary with no preamble, labels, markdown or quotes.

Here's the context for the scene to summarize:

${sceneContext}

Here's the scene to summarize:
